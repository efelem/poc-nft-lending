# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic NFTCollateralLoan smart contract project. It uses Hardhat and was set up with hardhat init. 
It comes with a sample NFTCollateralLoan contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract and associated Mock contract to get things running on testnet.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/NFTCollateralLoanTestnet.ts
```
